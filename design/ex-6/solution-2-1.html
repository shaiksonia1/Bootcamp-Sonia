        <!-- Indian Government Press Releases -->
        <div class="website-review">
          <h2>1. Indian Government Press Releases</h2>
          <p><strong>Problems:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Cluttered Design:</strong> The website uses an outdated, text-heavy design that makes it difficult for users to quickly grasp the key information.</li>
            <li><strong>Navigation Issues:</strong> The site lacks a structured navigation system, making it hard to filter press releases by department or topic.</li>
            <li><strong>No Search Functionality:</strong> There is no search bar to allow users to find specific press releases.</li>
            <li><strong>Not Mobile-Friendly:</strong> The design does not scale well for mobile devices, forcing users to zoom in and out.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Suggested Improvements:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Implement a modern, minimalistic design with clear typography and whitespace.</li>
            <li>Introduce a search function and improve navigation (e.g., by department or topic).</li>
            <li>Make the website responsive to provide a better experience on mobile devices.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Inspiration:</strong></p>
          <p>The US Department of State website is an excellent example of a modern, user-friendly government press release site. It features a clean design, well-organized content, and a robust search feature.</p>

          </ul>

          <p><strong>Suggested Improvements:</strong></p>
