    <h1>Exercise 2: Basics of Colors</h1>
    <h2>Thought Process</h2>
    <div class="notes">
        <p>
            I explored color theory concepts such as color wheels, themes, and combinations to design visually appealing web pages. 
            My objective was to experiment with various CSS color formats (hex, RGB, HSL) and use transparency, shadows, and borders 
            to enhance the design elements.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Level 1: Monochromatic and Complementary Themes</h2>
    <div class="notes">
        <p>
            I started by creating a card design with a monochromatic theme based on a single base color. To make the card stand out, 
            I used alpha transparency for subtle shadows and borders. In the second version, I applied a complementary color scheme 
            to create a clear contrast between elements. Finally, I extended the design to a three-color scheme by adding an accent 
            color for headers, links, and buttons.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each version of the page was saved separately to showcase the changes (e.g., <code>solution-2-1.html</code>, 
            <code>solution-2-2.html</code>).
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Level 2: Dark and Light Themes</h2>
    <div class="notes">
        <p>
            I implemented dark and light themes using CSS variables to define primary, secondary, and background colors. Two 
            separate stylesheets were created for dark and light modes. An image with overlaid text was styled to maintain contrast 
            in both themes. I ensured the text and overlay colors worked well together for readability.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also built a color swatch page using HSL values. By varying saturation and lightness, I generated a grid of labeled 
            swatches to demonstrate the flexibility of HSL in creating cohesive color palettes.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Level 3: Advanced Color Techniques</h2>
    <div class="notes">
        <p>
            I designed a gradient-based theme with linear gradients for headers and radial gradients for buttons. This version 
            demonstrated how gradient angles and stops can significantly affect the design's appearance. A responsive color palette 
            was created using CSS functions like <code>lighten()</code> and <code>darken()</code> to generate tints and shades for 
            the base colors. Media queries were used to apply the palette dynamically for different screen sizes.
        </p>
        <p>
            To emphasize accessibility, I developed a contrast demonstration page, showcasing how various color combinations meet 
            accessibility standards. Borders and shadows were added to enhance the visual hierarchy and create a professional look.
