        <h2>Linear and Radial Gradients</h2>
        <p>Radial and linear gradients are both ways of transitioning between multiple colors smoothly. A linear gradient creates a gradual change of color along a straight line, which can be set at any angle (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal). For example, it can transition from one color to another in a left-to-right or top-to-bottom direction. On the other hand, a radial gradient radiates color from a central point, creating a circular or elliptical pattern where the colors change outward from the center. Both are commonly used in web design to add depth, visual interest, and smooth color transitions.</p>

        <p>In this case, the gradient includes custom color stops, where the red color starts at 20%, the turquoise at 50%, and red comes again at 80%.</p>

    <!-- Responsive Color Palette Section -->

        <h2>Responsive Color Palette</h2>
        <p>A responsive color palette involves adjusting colors based on the device or viewport size, ensuring an optimized user experience across different screen sizes. By using media queries at specific breakpoints, developers can change the color scheme of a website to adapt to various device types (like mobile, tablet, or desktop). For instance, a background color might shift from a light shade on larger screens to a darker tone on smaller devices, improving readability and visual appeal. This approach helps maintain consistency in design, enhancing accessibility and user engagement across a wide range of devices.</p>

    <section class="contrast-section">
        <h2>Contrast Demonstration</h2>
        <p>A contrast demonstration page showcases various color combinations to ensure they meet accessibility standards, particularly for users with visual impairments. By adjusting color contrasts between text and background, developers can make sure that content is legible and meets the required contrast ratios. Borders and shadows are often used to enhance the visual hierarchy, helping distinguish different elements on the page. These design techniques not only improve accessibility but also provide a clear, aesthetically pleasing layout that guides usersâ€™ focus to important areas, improving overall usability.</p>
