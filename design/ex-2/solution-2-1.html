            <p> <a href="https://www.flux-academy.com/blog/how-to-strategically-use-color-in-website-design">Monochromatic</a> color palettes use different shades and tints of one color. They are harmonious and can be accented with a complementary color for emphasis.
                However, it's a good idea to add a complementary color to a monochromatic palette in web design in order to draw attention to important elements.

    <h2>Exercise 2: Basics of Colors (Level-1)    </h2>


    <p>I learned that a monochromatic color scheme uses various shades and tints of a single color. This creates a smooth, harmonious design, but to avoid it looking too plain, I can add accents or textures to give it more depth and interest.</p>
        <p>I also learned that a complementary color scheme uses colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel, like red and green or blue and orange. This contrast makes the colors pop, but I need to be careful not to overuse them, as too much contrast can be harsh. Balancing these colors with neutrals helps to make the design more pleasant.

        </p>
        <p>Lastly, I learned about the three-color scheme, which uses three colors spaced evenly on the color wheel. This creates a balanced, dynamic look while still feeling cohesive. It's great for adding accent colors and highlighting specific elements, providing variety without overwhelming the design.</p>
