            <p>To create a typographic hierarchy on my page, I combined multiple font families to distinguish between different content types, such as headers and body text. For the headings, I used Playfair Display, a serif font, which adds elegance and a strong visual presence to titles and subheadings. I adjusted the font weight, letter-spacing, and line-height to make the headers stand out without compromising readability. For the body text, I selected Roboto, a clean sans-serif font, known for its legibility. I tweaked the font size, line height, and letter-spacing to ensure the body text is comfortable to read on various screen sizes, contributing to a balanced and aesthetically pleasing layout.</p>
            <p>In addition to these Google Fonts, I also used a locally stored font, Geist, for key emphasis areas on the page. This added a unique touch while maintaining readability. By adjusting font properties like size, weight, and spacing, I ensured that the content hierarchy was clear and visually appealing. The careful combination of these fonts allows for a seamless flow of information, with headers catching attention while the body text remains easy to read, improving both the usability and the design of the page.</p>

            <h3>So What is This About?</h3>
            <p>To implement a typographic hierarchy, I used multiple font families for headers and body text, adjusting font sizes, weights, and spacing for better readability. For the headers, I used Playfair Display with a larger font size and increased letter-spacing to give it a bold and elegant appearance. I set the line-height to 1.2 to ensure the text has enough vertical space, making it more visually appealing and easier to distinguish from the body text.</p>
