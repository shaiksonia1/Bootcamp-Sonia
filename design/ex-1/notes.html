    <h1>Exercise 1: Basics of Fonts</h1>
    <h2>Thought Process</h2>
    <div class="notes">
        <p>
            I approached this exercise by breaking it down into three levels to understand and apply font styles systematically. 
            My goal was to experiment with system fonts, Google Fonts, and custom fonts while understanding the basics of typography.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Level 1: System Fonts</h2>
    <div class="notes">
        <p>
            I started with system fonts such as Arial, Times New Roman, and Courier. Different font weights were applied to various 
            sections of the text to observe the effects of bold, light, and normal weights. This helped me create a visual hierarchy.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Level 2: Google Fonts and Variable Fonts</h2>
    <div class="notes">
        <p>
            I integrated Google Fonts for better design flexibility. I used a sans-serif font for body text, a serif font for 
            headings, and a monospace font for code snippets. Variable fonts were explored to illustrate the flexibility in adjusting 
            weights dynamically. I used drop caps, shadows, and text masking to make text visually appealing.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Level 3: Custom Fonts and Hierarchy</h2>
    <div class="notes">
        <p>
            A custom font called Geist was installed locally and applied to the page. To enhance typographic hierarchy, I combined 
            multiple font families, using distinct fonts for headers and body text. Font spacing, line height, and paragraph 
            alignment were adjusted to ensure readability and style consistency.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Problem-Solving Approach</h2>
    <div class="notes">
        <p>
            For each level, I iteratively tested and refined the styles. Challenges, such as loading fonts and applying advanced 
            typography features, were addressed by referring to documentation and testing various configurations. Each section 
            of the page contains comments and descriptions to guide users through the changes and effects.
