    <h1>Exercise 5: Layout Principles</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Thought Process</h2>
        <p>
            For this exercise, I wanted to create a simple and structured layout by applying the core principles of spacing, alignment, and visual hierarchy. I focused on both understanding how to use the space on a webpage effectively and how to apply consistent styling to create a professional look.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consistent Margins and Padding:</strong> I realized that using consistent margins and padding makes the content easier to read and helps separate different sections clearly. It also prevents the design from feeling cluttered.</li>
            <li><strong>White Space:</strong> I learned how important white space is in creating breathing room between sections. It ensures the layout isn't overwhelming and helps guide the reader's eye.</li>
            <li><strong>Text and Image Alignment:</strong> Correct alignment of text and images improves readability and gives a clean, organized look to the webpage.</li>
            <li><strong>Visual Hierarchy:</strong> I discovered how varying font sizes, boldness, and color can help emphasize important content, making it more engaging for the reader.</li>
            <li><strong>CSS Grid System:</strong> Using CSS grid made it easier to organize the content into sections, and it allowed me to align elements both vertically and horizontally without complex positioning rules.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Approach to the Exercise</h2>
        <p>
            My approach was divided into two levels:
        </p>
        <h3>Level 1: Simple Webpage Layout</h3>
        <p>
            I started by recreating a basic layout similar to a Medium article. I focused on applying consistent margins and padding throughout the page, ensuring that each section was well-spaced and easy to read. I used a minimalistic design approach, relying heavily on white space to create a sense of separation between sections. Text and images were aligned using basic block and inline-block properties to maintain visual order.
        </p>

        <h3>Level 2: Emphasizing Visual Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>
            For the second level, I designed a homepage layout that included a large hero section at the top, a grid of featured articles below, and a footer at the bottom. I used larger font sizes and bolder colors for headings and important elements to create a strong visual hierarchy. I ensured there were gutters between sections, which helped maintain clarity between different parts of the page. To organize the content further, I applied a CSS grid system, which allowed me to easily manage the layout and ensure all elements were properly aligned.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="key-challenges">
        <h2>Key Challenges Faced</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Balancing White Space:</strong> Initially, I found it tricky to find the right amount of white space without making the page feel too empty. I experimented with different values for margins and padding until I found the right balance.</li>
            <li><strong>Grid Layout Issues:</strong> Understanding how to work with the CSS grid system took some time. It was important to use grid properties like <code>grid-template-columns</code> and <code>gap</code> effectively, and I had to test several variations before I achieved the desired results.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            This exercise taught me how to create a visually appealing layout with a focus on spacing, alignment, and hierarchy. I now feel more comfortable using CSS grid and applying visual hierarchy techniques to make a webpage more engaging. I also gained a deeper understanding of how to design for readability and clarity, which will help me in future projects.
