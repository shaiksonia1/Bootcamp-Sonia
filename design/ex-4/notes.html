    <h1>Exercise 4: Basics of Images</h1>

    <h2>Thought Process</h2>
    <p>In this exercise, I explored various aspects of image handling in web development. I started by understanding the differences between JPEG, PNG, and SVG formats and their respective use cases.</p>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Images are a critical part of modern web design. To begin, I reviewed different image formats:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>JPEG:</strong> Used for photographs due to its efficient compression.</li>
        <li><strong>PNG:</strong> Best for graphics with transparency.</li>
        <li><strong>SVG:</strong> Ideal for scalable, resolution-independent icons and illustrations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also focused on basic editing techniques, such as resizing, compression, and applying transparency.</p>

    <h3>Level 1: Basics of Image Handling</h3>
    <p>In this step, I added images to the webpage and styled them using CSS. Key tasks included:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Applying <strong>width</strong> and <strong>height</strong> styles to control image dimensions.</li>
        <li>Using <strong>border-radius</strong> to create rounded corners for a modern look.</li>
        <li>Experimenting with placeholder image services, like Lorem Picsum, to quickly add generic images for practice.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This step helped me get comfortable with basic image handling techniques.</p>

    <h3>Level 2: Styling and Overlays</h3>
    <p>Here, I focused on making images more visually appealing by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Adding a <strong>full-bleed image</strong> as a page header for a bold, modern design.</li>
        <li>Applying <strong>overlays</strong> using CSS gradients and semi-transparent colors to enhance readability of text over images.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These techniques helped me understand how to integrate images seamlessly into the design.</p>

    <h3>Level 3: Responsive and Optimized Images</h3>
    <p>In the advanced section, I explored ways to make images more efficient and responsive:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Used the <strong>&lt;picture&gt;</strong> element to serve different images for various screen sizes and resolutions.</li>
        <li>Focused on <strong>lazy loading</strong> to optimize image loading and improve page performance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These practices ensure that the webpage is optimized for both performance and visual quality across devices.</p>
