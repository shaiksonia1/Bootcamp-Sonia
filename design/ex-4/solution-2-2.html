    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>In this exercise, I focused on styling images on a webpage using CSS. I set fixed dimensions for the images and used object-fit: cover to maintain their aspect ratio without distortion. I also applied Lorem Picsum for random placeholder images and added rounded corners and a box-shadow for a polished look.</p>
    <p>For the page header, I created a full-bleed image that stretched across the entire width of the viewport. To make the text readable, I used a gradient overlay with the ::before pseudo-element. Additionally, I added a hover effect to the gallery images with CSS transitions to create a zoom-in effect. This exercise helped me practice image manipulation, overlays, and interactive design.</p>
    <p>A full-bleed image stretches across the entire width (and sometimes height) of a container or viewport, creating a seamless visual effect with no margins or padding. It is commonly used in web design for headers or hero sections to create an impactful first impression.</p>
