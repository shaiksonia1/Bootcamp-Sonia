            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>The goal of this exercise was to style a webpage without using any classes or IDs. This forces you to rely on element selectors and default browser styling to manage the design.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In this exercise, I explored how blogs and markdown content are often converted into HTML without the need for additional markup like classes or IDs. I also learned about **normalize.css** and its role in resetting browser styles. The exercise helped me understand how to style basic HTML elements with minimal CSS and without any class-based structure.</p>

            <h2>Solution Links</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="./solution-1.html">Solution 1</a></li>
                <li><a href="./solution-2.html">Solution 2</a></li>
                <li><a href="./solution-3.html">Solution 3</a></li>

            <h2>Level 1: Basic Blog Post Styling</h2>
            <p>For the first step, I was given a basic blog post content to style:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Title:</strong> "My Blog Post"</li>
                <li><strong>Subtitle:</strong> "Exploring Classless CSS"</li>
                <li><strong>Paragraph:</strong> "Classless CSS is a minimalistic way to style web pages without assigning classes or IDs to elements."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Using **classless CSS**, I centered the content and applied basic margins to create a simple yet clean design.</p>
            <p>Hereâ€™s what I did:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Used element selectors to target the title, subtitle, and paragraph.</li>
                <li>Centered the content horizontally and vertically using text alignment and margins.</li>
                <li>Applied basic margin and padding to space out the content.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Level 2: Styling Additional Elements</h2>
            <p>Next, I added more content to the blog post, including a list, a blockquote, and an inline code snippet. To style these, I used element selectors, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>List:</strong> Styled the <code>ul</code> and <code>li</code> elements to create proper spacing.</li>
                <li><strong>Blockquote:</strong> Applied margins and italics to the <code>blockquote</code> element for emphasis.</li>
                <li><strong>Inline Code:</strong> Used the <code>code</code> element selector to style inline code snippets with a different font-family.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The goal was to use minimal CSS and rely on the default element selectors to style the content cleanly and clearly without using extra markup.</p>

            <h2>Level 3: Using Classless CSS Frameworks</h2>
            <p>For this step, I explored a few **classless CSS frameworks** like <a href="https://classless.de">classless.de</a>. These frameworks help to style elements without the need for classes or IDs. They provide a simple and clean base styling for most common HTML elements.</p>
            <p>After experimenting with these frameworks, I chose one that provided a minimalist design and easy-to-use layout components. Here are the things I liked about it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The styles were simple and worked well with basic HTML elements.</li>
                <li>No extra complexity from classes or IDs, making it easy to focus on the content itself.</li>
                <li>It included default styles for elements like blockquotes, lists, and headers, which saved a lot of time.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I used this framework to enhance the design of my blog post, ensuring the page remained clean, readable, and minimalistic.</p>

            <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
            <p>While working on this exercise, I faced a few challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Limited control:</strong> Without classes or IDs, it was harder to target specific elements for styling.</li>
                <li><strong>Less flexibility:</strong> Customizing individual elements (like adding specific colors to certain links) was trickier without classes.</li>
                <li><strong>Overriding default browser styles:</strong> Even with normalize.css, some default browser styles had to be manually adjusted to achieve the desired look.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>GPT Chat Reference</h2>
            <p>During this exercise, I used GPT Chat for assistance with the challenges I faced, especially when trying to style certain elements without classes. The following conversation helped me:</p>
