            <h2>Overview of the Exercise 4</h2>
            <p>This exercise focused on using various CSS units and responsive design techniques to create flexible and scalable web pages. The goal was to work with different units like <code>px</code>, <code>em</code>, <code>rem</code>, <code>vh</code>, <code>vw</code>, and functions like <code>min()</code>, <code>max()</code>, and <code>clamp()</code> to create fluid and responsive layouts.</p>

            <h2>Thought Process</h2>
            <p>Here's how I approached each level in Exercise 4:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Level 1</strong> - In the first level, I created a basic centered webpage layout using percentage-based widths and viewport units like <code>vh</code> and <code>vw</code> to center the content horizontally and vertically. The goal was to create a flexible layout that adapts to various screen sizes.</li>
                <li><strong>Level 2</strong> - For the second level, I explored the use of <code>min()</code>, <code>max()</code>, and <code>clamp()</code> functions for font sizes and widths. These functions allow for scalable designs where content adjusts according to the viewport size, making the page more readable on different screen sizes.</li>
                <li><strong>Level 3</strong> - In the third level, I implemented a flexible grid system and fluid typography to make the layout and text responsive without relying on fixed breakpoints. This involved using CSS Grid and <code>clamp()</code> for font sizes to ensure content scales appropriately on all devices.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
            <p>During the development of this project, I encountered a few challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understanding how to effectively use viewport units like <code>vh</code> and <code>vw</code> took some time, as these units scale based on the size of the viewport and not the container.</li>
                <li>Implementing fluid typography with <code>clamp()</code> was a bit tricky at first, but it proved to be a powerful way to make text responsive without breaking the layout.</li>
                <li>Creating a fully responsive grid system without relying on fixed breakpoints required experimenting with CSS Grid properties like <code>minmax()</code> and <code>auto-fit</code>.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
            <p>This exercise helped me learn how to use CSS units and responsive design techniques to create flexible and scalable layouts. I learned how to use viewport units, the <code>clamp()</code> function for fluid typography, and how to design using flexible grids without fixed breakpoints. These techniques help ensure that web pages are adaptable to various screen sizes, from mobile devices to large desktop monitors.</p>
