            <h2>Overview of the Exercise-1</h2>
            <p>This project consists of three different web pages with unique layouts, ranging from simple content presentation to navigation-based layouts. Below are the details of each page, along with the challenges I encountered and my thought process for developing them.</p>

                <h2>Thought Process</h2>
                <p>Here's how I approached each solution while building this project:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Solution 1</strong> - The first step was creating a basic webpage with an ordered list of my favorite movies and an unordered list of books. I added an image to make it more visually appealing. The focus here was to build a clean and simple structure, ensuring that the content was easy to follow and read.</li>
                    <li><strong>Solution 2</strong> - In this step, I introduced more complexity by adding two side navigation bars. These navigation bars allowed for more options and links, which made the page look more dynamic. I used inline and internal CSS to position and style the elements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Solution 3</strong> - This version expanded on the previous one by adding detailed content. I included descriptions for movies and books and displayed a table for additional information. The main challenge here was keeping everything well-organized while maintaining readability, especially with the added navigation bars. I also had to ensure that the content didnâ€™t feel overwhelming despite the added sections.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
            <p>During the development of this project, I faced a few challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Positioning the left and right navigation bars correctly was tricky without using CSS frameworks. I had to experiment with different float settings to get them right.</li>
                <li>Making sure the page content was spaced well and easy to read, especially when I added more sections, was a bit challenging.</li>
                <li>Adding more details to the content while keeping the page clean and simple, particularly in the movie and book lists, was a bit tricky.</li>
            </ul>
