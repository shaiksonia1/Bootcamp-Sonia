            <h2>Overview of Exercise 2</h2>
            <p>This exercise focuses on learning how to use CSS variables to manage styles efficiently. The project involved creating a simple webpage and applying CSS variables to handle colors, fonts, and spacing. Below are the details of the steps taken to complete this exercise, along with the challenges I faced during development.</p>

            <h2>Thought Process</h2>
            <p>Here's how I approached each part of the exercise:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Solution 1:</strong> In this step, I focused on creating a simple webpage with a clean structure. I defined variables for primary and secondary colors, font sizes, and margins in a separate CSS file. This made it easier to maintain consistency across the page and quickly apply style changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Solution 2:</strong> For this part, I added more styling by using default values for some variables and styling a table with alternating row colors using `nth-child`. I also learned how to use `min()`, `max()`, and `clamp()` to create responsive font sizes.</li>
                <li><strong>Solution 3:</strong> This step introduced more advanced concepts, such as defining variables based on other variables (e.g., `--secondary-color: var(--primary-color)`). I also implemented a theme switcher to toggle between light and dark modes, which made the webpage more dynamic and user-friendly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
            <p>During this exercise, I faced the following challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understanding how to use CSS variables for managing colors and layout efficiently was initially tricky.</li>
                <li>Finding the right balance in font sizes and spacing to ensure readability across devices was a challenge, especially when using responsive units like `vw` and `vh`.</li>
                <li>Implementing the theme switcher required understanding how to link multiple CSS files and toggle between styles without complex JavaScript.</li>
            </ul>
