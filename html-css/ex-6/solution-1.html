            <h2>Overview of What I Did</h2>
            <p>To enhance my knowledge and stay updated with the latest trends in web development, I followed several key steps. I set up daily.dev as my homepage, customized my feed to show relevant articles, and subscribed to newsletters and websites focused on JavaScript, CSS, React, and Frontend development.</p>

            <h2>What I Gained from This</h2>
            <p>By browsing through these resources and subscribing to relevant newsletters, I gained a deeper understanding of several key web development topics, especially in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/React. Here are some of the key learnings:</p>
        
            <h3>1. Improved HTML Semantics and Accessibility</h3>
            <p>One of the major improvements in my web development skills was learning more about HTML semantics and accessibility. I realized the importance of using semantic HTML elements like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> to structure content logically. This practice not only improves SEO but also makes websites more accessible to screen readers. I now prioritize using appropriate tags to ensure that my web pages are more inclusive and SEO-friendly.</p>
        
            <h3>2. Mastering Modern CSS Layouts (Flexbox & Grid)</h3>
            <p>Through various resources like CSS Weekly and tutorials from channels like <strong>Academind</strong> and <strong>Traversy Media</strong>, I gained a solid understanding of modern CSS layout techniques such as Flexbox and CSS Grid. These tools have made it much easier for me to create responsive and flexible layouts. I learned how to use <code>display: flex</code> and <code>display: grid</code> to manage complex layouts without relying on hacks like floats. These techniques have made my designs more adaptive, reducing the need for media queries and making my websites work seamlessly across different screen sizes.</p>
        
            <h3>3. Deepening My Knowledge of React and State Management</h3>
            <p>React is one of the most powerful JavaScript libraries for building modern web apps, and through resources like <strong>This Week in React</strong>, I gained a better understanding of React's component-based architecture and state management techniques. I learned about React hooks, such as <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code>, which simplify state management and side effects in functional components. I also explored more advanced state management tools like Redux, which helped me handle complex application states more efficiently. This knowledge has greatly improved my ability to build dynamic, interactive web applications.</p>
