    <h1>Development Notes: Vite Full Exercise</h1>

    <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Environment Configuration:</strong> Setting up and managing .env files for different environments was tricky, especially ensuring the correct variables were loaded during builds.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Type Checking:</strong> Integrating vite-plugin-checker for TypeScript type checking in real time exposed several hidden errors, which took time to resolve.</li>
        <li><strong>Linting Workflow:</strong> Configuring vite-plugin-eslint and ensuring all team members adhered to consistent coding standards was initially challenging.</li>
        <li><strong>Lazy Loading:</strong> Implementing lazy loading and code splitting required a deep understanding of module structures and dependencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Ensuring minification and tree-shaking worked as expected during production builds posed some debugging challenges.</li>
        <li><strong>Error Display:</strong> Customizing error displays during builds to make them actionable and less overwhelming required additional configurations.</li>
        <li><strong>SCSS Integration:</strong> Writing SCSS loops for utility classes and ensuring compatibility with the Vite setup needed some experimentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing Performance:</strong> Evaluating the production build's performance and identifying bottlenecks was time-consuming but insightful.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Improvements for Future Iterations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Streamlined Environment Management:</strong> Create a reusable script to validate and manage environment variables across different environments.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Type Checking:</strong> Incorporate stricter TypeScript configurations to catch potential issues earlier in the development process.</li>
        <li><strong>Automated Linting:</strong> Use tools like Husky to run linting and type-checking on pre-commit hooks for improved workflow automation.</li>
        <li><strong>Lazy Loading Strategies:</strong> Explore additional strategies for lazy loading, such as route-based splitting, to optimize large applications further.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Analysis Tools:</strong> Integrate tools like Lighthouse and Webpack Bundle Analyzer to continuously monitor and improve application performance.</li>
        <li><strong>SCSS Refactoring:</strong> Use mixins and functions in SCSS to reduce repetitive code and enhance maintainability.</li>
        <li><strong>Detailed Error Reporting:</strong> Implement a more user-friendly error reporting system to make debugging easier for the development team.</li>
        <li><strong>Comprehensive Testing:</strong> Add end-to-end testing with tools like Cypress to complement unit and integration tests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Environment-specific configurations are critical for seamless development and production workflows.</li>
        <li>Real-time linting and type checking improve code quality but require proper setup and maintenance.</li>
        <li>Lazy loading and code splitting significantly enhance user experience by reducing initial load times.</li>
        <li>SCSS provides powerful tools for styling automation, making complex designs easier to implement and maintain.</li>
        <li>Performance optimization is an ongoing process that demands continuous analysis and iteration.</li>
        <li>Comprehensive error reporting and testing practices lead to more robust and reliable applications.</li>
    </ul>
