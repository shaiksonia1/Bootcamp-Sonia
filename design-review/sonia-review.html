        <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> The design exercises are easily accessible on the website. They are well-organized and clearly listed, making navigation straightforward.</p>
        <p><strong>Clarity:</strong> Each solution clearly indicates which problem it addresses. This information is included in the notes.html file and linked to the respective problem, ensuring clarity.        </p>
        <p><strong>Thought Process:</strong> The notes.html file provides an overview of the approach to solving each problem. However, it could be improved by including a more detailed explanation of the thought process, problem-solving strategy, what worked, and what didn’t. This would offer deeper insights into the design decisions.</p>
        <p><strong>Overall Areas for Improvement:</strong> The design exercises demonstrate strong effort but could benefit from improvements in documentation, such as detailing the thought process and summarizing insights for quicker understanding. Additionally, enhancing accessibility features, refining design elements like spacing and hover effects, and expanding the use of variable fonts would further elevate the overall quality.</p>

        <p>The exercises on font basics have a solid foundation, with clear structure and readability enhancements like bold text and consistent sectioning. However, there is room for improvement in clearly identifying updated font styles and weights to avoid confusion. The distinction between different font weights could be more pronounced, and a legend or note would help users understand which styles are applied where. Additionally, adjustments like consistent margins, padding, and alignment would further enhance the overall layout and readability.</p>

        <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> The design exercises are readily accessible and logically organized on the website.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Clarity:</strong> Each solution clearly specifies the problem it solves. This information is included in the notes.html file and is linked to the corresponding problem for better clarity.       </p>
        <p><strong>Thought Process:</strong> The `notes.html` file offers a general overview of the approach taken to solve each problem. However, it can be enhanced by providing a more in-depth explanation of the thought process, the problem-solving strategy, the challenges encountered, and the aspects that worked well or didn’t. Including these details would offer valuable insights into the design decisions and improve the overall clarity of the solutions.</p>
        <p><strong>Overall Areas for Improvement:</strong> The design exercises reflect a strong effort but could be enhanced with better documentation, including a more detailed explanation of the thought process and a concise summary of key insights for easier comprehension. Furthermore, improving accessibility features, refining design elements such as spacing and hover effects, and incorporating more variable fonts would significantly elevate the overall quality of the work.</p>

        <p>The design exercises demonstrate a solid understanding of core principles like typography, color theory, and layout organization, with clear structure and functional elements. The use of fonts and color schemes effectively enhances readability and aesthetic appeal. However, there is room for improvement in spacing, margin adjustments, and refining interactive elements to elevate the overall visual experience.

        <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> The design exercises are easily accessible on the website. They are well-organized and clearly listed, making navigation straightforward.</p>
        <p><strong>Clarity:</strong> Each solution clearly indicates which problem it addresses. This information is included in the notes.html file and linked to the respective problem, ensuring clarity.        </p>
        <p><strong>Thought Process:</strong> The notes.html file provides an overview of the approach to solving each problem. However, it could be improved by including a more detailed explanation of the thought process, problem-solving strategy, what worked, and what didn’t. This would offer deeper insights into the design decisions.</p>
        <p><strong>Overall Areas for Improvement:</strong> The design exercises demonstrate strong effort but could benefit from improvements in documentation, such as detailing the thought process and summarizing insights for quicker understanding. Additionally, enhancing accessibility features, refining design elements like spacing and hover effects, and expanding the use of variable fonts would further elevate the overall quality.</p>

        <p>Overall, the exercises showcase a strong understanding of design principles, with well-executed typography, color schemes, and icon usage. The implementation of hover effects, responsive images, and structured layouts significantly enhances user experience. However, further refinement in areas like contrast, font weight variations, and context explanation could elevate the designs. Adding interactive elements and additional context would improve clarity and engagement across the exercises.</p>
