                <ul>
                    <li>The solution is clearly presented on the homepage, with a prominent "WELCOME TO 1000 RESEARCH PAPERS" heading. However, the filters are located on the left side, which might not be immediately noticeable to some users.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Is it self-explanatory? Do you understand what it is doing? </h4>
                <p class="rating">Rating:(7/10)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The functionality is straightforward: filter research papers by author, title, year, or export as CSV. However, the visual design could be more intuitive. For example, the filters could be more visually distinct from the paper previews.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>How is the usability of the site?</h4>
                <p class="rating">Rating:(6/10)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The site is functional, but the usability could be improved. The filters are somewhat cluttered, and the paper previews are not very visually appealing. Additionally, there's no clear indication of how many papers are being filtered or how many results are available.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>How pleasing is the site?</h4>
                <p class="rating">Rating:(6/10)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The visual design is basic and lacks personality. The color scheme is bland, and the layout is somewhat cramped. The font choices are generic and don't add much visual interest.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Code Review</h4>
                <li>The code is well-organized and follows a clean structure, which makes it easy to navigate. However, there are some areas where performance could be improved, especially in terms of image optimization. Consider adding more comments to explain the purpose of specific functions./li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Changing the design would likely involve modifying CSS and HTML files. The code appears to be well-structured, which should make it relatively easy to make changes.

                <ul>
                    <li>To further enhance the Weather App, several recommendations can be considered. Adding more unique design elements will help differentiate it from other weather applications. Implementing robust error handling and data validation mechanisms will significantly improve the user experience. Finally, optimizing the site for performance and scalability is crucial to ensure it can handle a larger number of users and API requests effectively.</li>

        <h2>Final Comments</h2>
        <p>Both websites demonstrate functional designs with varying degrees of success. The research paper website, while functional, suffers from a basic and uninspiring design. The filters are cluttered, and the overall aesthetic lacks personality. However, the underlying code appears to be well-organized, making it relatively easy to implement improvements.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the weather app presents a much more polished design. The visual appeal is strong with a well-chosen color scheme and typography. The functionality is straightforward and easy to understand. While there's room for improvement in terms of unique design elements and scalability, the weather app provides a good example of a well-designed and user-friendly application.</p>
