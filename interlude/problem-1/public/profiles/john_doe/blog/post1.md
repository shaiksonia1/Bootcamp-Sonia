Welcome to my first blog post! In this post, we'll explore the basics of **Next.js** and why it's an excellent framework for building React applications.

Next.js provides features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes, which help make web development easier and faster.

### Key Features of Next.js:

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-render pages at build time.
- **API Routes**: Build APIs directly within your Next.js project.
