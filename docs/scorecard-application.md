# ASSIGNMENT-1 : Scorecard Application for Antibody Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a **Scorecard Application** that assists in the analysis and optimization of antibodies based on their physicochemical properties. The application will fetch data from an API, display a scorecard for each antibody with their corresponding properties and scores, and allow visualization of their **3D molecular structure** to highlight regions requiring optimization.

## Background
Antibodies are **therapeutic proteins** used in various medical treatments, including cancer therapies and disease management. They recognize and bind to specific molecules, and their physicochemical properties determine their developability, stability, and efficacy.

## Features and Requirements

### Antibody Scorecard
- Displays a scorecard with antibodies listed by their IDs or names.
- Each antibody has properties such as hydrophobicity, charge distribution, solubility, and aggregation tendency.
- Scores are color-coded:
  - **Green:** Property is within the ideal range.
  - **Amber:** Property is borderline.
  - **Red:** Property is out of range.

### 3D Visualization of Antibody Structures
- Users can click a "View Structure" button to view the 3D structure.
- Mol*Star, a JavaScript library, will be used for rendering.
- Color-coded properties like charge distribution and hydrophobicity.

### Interactive Feature
- Users can highlight undesirable regions in the 3D visualization.
- Simulate mutations and analyze property changes.

### API Integration
- Fetches antibody property data from a FastAPI backend.
- Supports Protein Data Bank (PDB) format for 3D rendering.
- Provides detailed residue-specific properties in JSON format.

### User Interaction
- Users can input antibody IDs or select from a list.
- Analyze properties using the scorecard.
- Visualize the 3D structure and investigate concerns.

### Visualization
- 3D rendering based on PDB files using Mol*Star.
- Color gradients: **red** for high hydrophobicity, **blue** for hydrophilic regions.

### Property-Based Optimization
- Identifies problematic regions based on property scores.
- Suggests possible mutations for optimization.
- Visualizes mutation effects by recalculating property scores.


## Challenges
- **Data Integration:** Rendering data accurately in the scorecard and 3D model.
- **3D Visualization:** Implementing Mol*Star effectively.
- **User Interface:** Ensuring easy navigation for scientific users.
- **Mutation Simulation:** Developing a robust mutation analysis system.

## **Technical Stack**
- **Frontend:** Next.js, React.js
- **3D Visualization:** Molstar
- **API Integration:** Third-party API for fetching data
## Conclusion
This **Scorecard Application** will provide a data-driven approach to antibody analysis and optimization. By integrating **property scoring, interactive visualization, and mutation suggestions**, the application will help researchers enhance the design and efficacy of therapeutic antibodies.
