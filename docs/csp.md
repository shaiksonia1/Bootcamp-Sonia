# ASSIGNMENT-4 : Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) and Lattice Energy Determination

## Problem Definition
Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) is a computational problem aimed at determining the most stable arrangement of molecules or atoms in a crystalline solid. The goal is to predict stable crystal structures based on given molecular inputs and calculate their lattice energy to determine feasibility.

## Users
### Who Uses It?
- **Material Scientists**: To discover new materials with specific properties.
- **Pharmaceutical Industry**: To predict polymorphs of drug molecules.
- **Chemists and Physicists**: To explore fundamental properties of materials.
- **Manufacturers**: To optimize material properties for industrial applications.

### How Do They Use It?
- Provide molecular structure as input.
- Run computational models to generate potential crystal structures.
- Analyze energy landscapes to determine the most stable configuration.
- Use visualization tools to inspect structures and validate results.

## Plan
### Breaking Down the Problem
1. **Input Handling**
   - Accept molecular structures in standard formats (e.g., CIF, XYZ, PDB).
   - Validate input and preprocess (e.g., remove redundant atoms).
2. **Structure Generation**
   - Use algorithms like evolutionary methods, simulated annealing, or machine learning models to generate possible crystal structures.
3. **Energy Calculation**
   - Compute lattice energy using force fields, density functional theory (DFT), or other quantum mechanical methods.
4. **Ranking & Selection**
   - Rank predicted structures based on energy and stability.
5. **Validation & Visualization**
   - Compare with experimental data (if available).
   - Provide visualization tools for analysis.
